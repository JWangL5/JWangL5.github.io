            <div class="admonition-content"><p>Some of the least costly defenses, in terms of energy use, available to plants are structures that make penetration by predators difficult, if not impossible. These include tough leaves, spines, and epidermal hairs on leaves, which may trap, impale, or fence out insects and discourage browsing by vertebrate herbivores, as well as hard-coated seeds. These structures may have evolved early in the history of the plants, when they might have been subject to even greater predatory pressures. Because they represent little investment, plants still retain them.</p>
<p>Many seeds have thick, hard seed coats that provide protection from seed-eating animals. The problem with such seed defense is that the seeds need to be scarified—the hard seed needs scratching or scoring of the seed coat to weaken it—so the seedling itself can escape. If the seed is not scarified, the seedling embryo is sealed in, never to germinate. Many plants, however, have turned seed predation into a mechanism for seed dispersal, such as the transport and caching of seeds by squirrels, jays, mice, and ants.</p>
<p>The role of structural defenses in plants was largely presumed until experimental evidence was sought to demonstrate the effectiveness of such apparent defensive structures against grazing herbivores. Researchers investigated experimentally the effects of plant spinescence on the feeding habits of three large browsing mammalian herbivores of Africa. These were the kudu, a large African antelope attaining a female body weight of 180 kilograms; the impala, a medium-sized African antelope attaining a female body weight of 50 kg; and the Boer goat, a domestic ungulate weighing about 35 kg. The experimenters hand reared the antelope from calves to allow observation of feeding habits from very close range, 1 to 5 meters, under natural conditions, to determine biting rates the animals employed. They converted the bites to dry biomass by collecting samples of leaves and shoots of a size similar to those eaten and drying them to a constant weight. They calculated eating rate as the product of bite size (dry mass) and biting rate.</p>
<p>Another one of their experiments involved a detailed study to examine the influence of spinescence. They selected ten plants each of five species of trees at a height accessible to impalas outside the enclosure. The woody plants exhibited three basic types of spinescence: paired prickles or thorns situated in or close to the leaf axils; short, sharp-tipped branchlets or spines, sometimes carrying small leaves; and prickles of various kinds on leaves. Thorns were either straight and long, up to 70 millimeters, or short and sharply curved (hooked). On each tree, two branches were matched for size, shape, density of leaf cover, and ease of access to impalas. These paired branches were labeled and the thorns were removed from one of the branches in each pair. Two months later, researchers visually estimated the relative loss of foliage from browsing.</p>
<p>Results clearly showed that thorns and spines affected the feeding behavior of the three ungulates. These structures restricted bite sizes to mostly single leaves or leaf clusters, and hooked thorns retarded biting rates. Acceptability of leaves of those plant species offering small leaf size along with prickles was lower, at least for kudu, than those of other palatable plant species. The inhibitory effect of prickles was greater for impalas and goats than for kudu, which bit off the shoot ends in spite of the prickles. For certain straight-thorned species, kudu compensated partially for their slow eating rates by spending more time gathering the leaves. Most spinescent species were similar to unarmed palatable species in their acceptability to the ungulates, even though the armed species had a higher crude protein to their foliage. Probably these spinescent species, especially species of Acacia plants, would be preferred over unarmed species but for the thorns.</p>
<p>The main effect of these armed structural defense features is to restrict bite size, thus increasing handling time. Thorns, spines, and prickles restrict foliage losses to large herbivores. In addition, the animals may incur scar tissue in the esophagus and scratches in the mouth and throat. These experiments show that at least in some cases structural plant defenses are effective at protecting plants.</p>

        <div class="details-content">
            <div class="admonition-content"><p>Biological invasions by exotic species are an <u-r>escalating</u-r> threat to biodiversity around the globe.
Invasive species can displace native ones and <u-r>irrevocably</u-r> alter ecosystems.
Most imported species either die or have limited growth in their new home, but a small percentage of the newcomers are opportunists whose growth is dangerously out of control.
The story of how Caulerpa taxifolia became famous as one of these species began in 1989, when Dr. Alexandre Meinesz, a marine biologist at the University of Nice in France, learned that this exotic alga, which is native to the <u-g>Caribbean</u-g> and other tropical seas, was thriving in the <u-g>Mediterranean</u-g> waters off the coast of Monaco.
Upon investigation, Meinesz discovered that a mutant variety of C. taxifolia was dumped into the Mediterranean with other <u-r>aquarium</u-r> refuse by the prestigious Oceanographic Institute of Monaco.
Eventually, the C. taxifolia was traced back to a stock developed at the Wilhelma Zoological and Botanical Gardens in Stuttgart, Germany.
This stock of C. taxifolia had caught the attention of amateur and professional aquarists for its exceptional beauty and hardiness and had been widely distributed in public and private <u-r>aquaria</u-r> in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Instead of dying in the cold winter waters of the Mediterranean Sea as the tropical variety of C. taxifolia does, the mutant variety can withstand several months at temperatures that range between 10° and 13° C.
In addition, the alga grows equally well on a variety of ocean substrates—sand, mud, or rocks—and from near the surface to depths of 50 meters.
When temperatures exceed 18°C, the mutant Caulerpa grows at a remarkable rate, capable of elongating by 2 centimeters in a single day and forming a new frond every 2 days.
A single square meter of seafloor can be matted with 5,500 leafy <u-r>fronds</u-r>.
All of this growth is <u-r>asexual</u-r>.
Unlike the tropical form, the mutated form of C. taxifolia produces only male <u-r>gametes</u-r> in the Mediterranean and thus replicates only by fragmentation.
Just a small piece can regenerate and colonize an area.
In fact, it is believed that fishing nets and boat anchors as well as the ripping action of storms have helped the alga spread to new areas.</p>
<p>With such a rapid rate of growth, the Mediterranean Caulerpa grows quickly over the sea bottom, blanketing all other sea life such as marine <u-r>angiosperms</u-r>, native algae, corals, and <u-r>sea fans</u-r>.
lt cuts off vital essentials such as sunlight for photosynthesis and currents for filter feeding of nutrients.
The area becomes a Caulerpa <u-g>lawn</u-g> while species diversity is lost.
In addition, C, taxifolia is inedible to most marine <u-r>herbivores</u-r> because of the presence of toxic compounds, primarily caulerpenyne.
With no <u-r>predator</u-r> to inhibit its phenomenal growth, the alga had encompassed the Mediterranean coasts of Monaco, France, Italy, Spain, and the Croatian coast on the Adriatic Sea covering 30,000 hectares by 2002.
Caulerpa <u-r>infestations</u-r> have also been found in southern Australia, in estuaries near Sydney and Adelaide.</p>
<p>Various methods have been tried to eradicate this deadly invader.
Divers have been employed to rip the alga out by hand, but care must be taken because even a small fragment is capable of colonizing new areas.
Black plastic tarps have been placed over the alga in an attempt to deprive it of life-giving sunlight.
Chemicals such as copper, a conventional <u-r>algicide</u-r>, and toxic levels of salt have also been applied to Caulerpa fields.
There has been limited success but only if the area of invasion is small.</p>
<p>One hopeful avenue is biological control.
In biological control, a disease or predator of the invasive organism is introduced and allowed to destroy it.
In the native range of the tropical C. taxiolie, two species of sea slug are immune to its poisons and feed on the alga <strong>exclusively</strong>.
They suck the cytoplasm out of the leaves and incorporate the algal <u-r>chloroplasts</u-r>, the part of the plant that contains green photosynthetic pigment, into their skin. [█]
The chloroplasts provide camouflage as the snails feed in the Caulerpa fields and, surprisingly, continue to photosynthesize, providing additional nutrition for the slugs. [█]
Dr. Meinesz is suggesting the importation of these slugs to the Mediterranean as the only way to eliminate the <u-r><strong>immense</strong></u-r> area that Caulerpa now covers. [█]
But many experts fear that another exotic importation may lead to more environmental damage. [█]</p>

Caulerpa taxifolia is an invasive imported species that threatens the biodiversity of the Mediterranean.</p>
<ul>
<li>C. taxifolia first caught the attention of amateur and professional aquarists after it was widely distributed in public and private aquaria in the 1980s.</li>
<li><strong>Unlike the tropical variety, the mutant variety of C. taxifolia can endure both cold and warm temperatures and can reproduce extremely quickly.</strong></li>
<li><strong>C. taxiolia threatens sea life in the Mediterranean by cutting off access to life essentials such as sunlight and nutrients.</strong></li>
<li>Some experts believe that fishing nets, boat anchors, and even violent storms are to blame for the rapid spread of C. taxifolia.</li>
<li><strong>Attempts to eliminate C. taxifolia from the Mediterranean have met with only limited success, and an untried method of biological control is risky, some experts say.</strong></li>
<li>Not only are the algal chloroplasts of C. taxifolia harmless to the sea slugs that eat it, but they also provide additional nutrition for the predators.</li>
