<li><strong>To emphasize his point about the age of Chauvet paintings</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the professor’s opinion about the art at the Chauvet cave?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It is extremely well done</strong></li>
<li>It probably reflected artists’ religious beliefs</li>
<li>It is less sophisticated than the art at Lascaux and Altamira</li>
<li>It is probably not much older than the art at Lascaux and Altamira</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the professor, what is the significance of charcoal marks on the walls of the Chauvet cave?</p>
<ul>
<li>They suggest that Paleolithic people cooked their food in the cave</li>
<li><strong>They prove that people came to the cave long after the paintings were made</strong></li>
<li>They show how much light the Paleolithic artists needed for their work</li>
<li>They were used in recent times to date the paintings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compared to other Paleolithic art, what is unusual about the animals painted at Chauvet?</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of them are horses</li>
<li><strong>Many of them are dangerous</strong></li>
<li>Many of them are shown alongside humans</li>
<li>All of them are species that are still found in France</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are two questions about the Chauvet cave artists that the professor raises but cannot answer?</p>
<ul>
<li>How they lighted their work area</li>
<li>How they obtained pigments for their paints</li>
<li><strong>Why they chose to paint certain animals and not others</strong></li>
<li><strong>Why they placed their art in dark, uninhabited places</strong></li>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Some of the world&rsquo;s oldest preserved art is the cave art of Europe, most of it in Spain and France. And the earliest cave paintings found to date are those of the <strong>Chauvet Cave</strong> in France discovered in 1994.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">And you know, I remember when I heard about the results of the dating of the Chauvet paintings, I said to my wife, &ldquo;Can you believe these paintings are over 30,000 years old?&ldquo;and my 3-year-old daughter <u-g>piped up</u-g> and said, &ldquo;Is that older than my great-grandmother?&rdquo; [amused sounds from audience] But, uh, That was the oldest age she knew. And you know, come to think of it, It&rsquo;s pretty hard for me to really understandhow long 30,000 years is too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">I mean, we tend to think that people who lived at that time must have been pretty <u-r>primitive</u-r>&hellip;, but I&rsquo;m gonna show you some slides in a few minutes, and I think you&rsquo;ll agree with me that this art is anything but primitive-They are masterpieces.And they look so real, so alive that it&rsquo;s very hard to imagine that they are so very old.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Now, not everyone agrees on exactly how old. A number of the Chauvet paintings have been dated by a lab to 30,000 or more years ago. That would make them not just older than any other cave art, but about twice as old as the art in the caves at <strong>Altamira or Lascaux</strong>, which you may have heard of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Some people find it hard to believe Chauvet is so much older than Altamira and Lascaux, and they noted that only one lab did the dating for Chauvet, without independent confirmation from any other lab.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">But be that as it may, whatever the exact date, whether it&rsquo;s 15,000, 20,000 or 30,000 years ago, the Chauvet paintings are from the <u-r>dawn</u-r> of art, so they are a good place to start our discussion of cave painting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Now, one thing you&rsquo;ve got to remember is the context of these paintings. Paleolithic humans - that&rsquo;s the period we are talking about here, the Paleolithic, the early stone age, not too long after humans first arrived in Europe. The climate was significantly colder then, and so rock shelters-shallow caves-were valued as homes protected from the wind and rain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">And in some cases at least, artists drew on the walls of their homes.But many of the truly great cave art sites-like Chauvet-were never <u-r>inhabited</u-r>. These paintings were made deep inside a dark cave, where no natural light can <u-g>penetrate</u-g>. There&rsquo;s no evidence of people ever living here-Cave bears, yes, but not humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">You would have had to make a special trip into the cave to make the paintings, and a special trip to go see it, and each time you&rsquo;d have to bring along torches to light your way. And people did go see the art-there&rsquo;s <u-r>charcoal marks from their torches</u-r> on the cave walls, clearly dating from thousands of years after the paintings were made, so we can tell people went there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">They came but they didn&rsquo;t stay. Deep inside a cave like that is not really a place you&rsquo;d want to stay, so, why? What inspired the Paleolithic artists to make such beautiful art in such inaccessible places? We&rsquo;ll never really know, of course, though it&rsquo;s interesting to <u-g>speculate</u-g>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">But, um, getting to the paintings themselves. Virtually all Paleolithic cave art represents animals, and Chauvet is no exception. The artists were highly skilled at using-or even enhancing-the natural shape of the cave walls to give depth and perspectives to their drawings. The sense of motion and vitality in these animals-Well, wait till I show you the slides.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Anyway, most Paleolithic cave art depicts large herbivores. Horses are most common overall with deer and <u-r>bison</u-r> pretty common too. Probably animals they hunted. But earlier at Chauvet, there is a significant interest in large dangerous animals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Lots of <u-r>rhinoceros</u-r>, lions, mammoth, bears&hellip;remember that the ranges of many animal species were different back then, so all these animals actually lived in the region at that time-but the Chauvet artists didn&rsquo;t paint people. There is a half-man-half-bison creature and there is outlines of human hands, but no depiction of a full human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">So, why these <u-r>precise</u-r> animals? Why not birds, fish, snakes? Was it for their <u-r>religion</u-r>? Magic? Or sheer beauty? We don&rsquo;t know, but whatever it was, it was worth it to them to spend hours deep inside a cave with just a torch between them and utter darkness. So&hellip;, on that note, let&rsquo;s dim the lights, so we can see these slides and actually look at the techniques they used.</td>

<li>古希腊最有名的艺术成就是各种雕塑，体现人体的完美性 (idealization of the human body), 比如，大家熟悉的《米洛斯的维纳斯》。</li>
<li>古希腊雕塑分为三个时期：古风时期(Archaic)、 古典时期(Classical)、希腊化时期(Hellenistic), 风格越来越成熟，而最杰出的希腊化时期的代表作就是《米洛斯的维纳斯》和《拉奥孔》。</li>
<li>古罗马人非常欣赏古希腊的雕塑，甚至会刻意做仿制品。但是，古罗马虽然创造力稍微弱一点，但是也有自己的独特之处。古罗马的雕塑主要是为了战争和政治服务，传达权力信息，比如：罗马帝国皇帝屋大维，又称Augustus的雕塑。</li>
<li>托福听力中讨论过古希腊和古罗马雕塑上是否有颜色，根据考古证据，原来确实有颜色。</li>
<li>在建筑方面，古希腊和古罗马也取得了辉煌的成就：古希腊的代表建筑是帕特农神庙 (Parthenon Temple), 而古罗马的代表建筑是万神殿 (Pantheon)。</li>
<li>万神殿由前面的方形神殿和后面的圆形穹顶组成，这座圆形穹顶直径43.4米，很长一段时间都是世界之最，穹顶中央有一个9米宽的圆洞。整个神殿没有窗户，全靠圆洞透光照亮厅堂。万神殿中还葬着文艺复兴时期的大师——拉斐尔。</li>

<td style="text-align:left">I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve all been to a museum where you&rsquo;ve seen beautiful white marble statues sculpted by the Greeks and Romans&hellip; or at least that you&rsquo;ve seen photos of such statues, right? We have come to expect these classical Greek and Roman statues to be <u-r>monochrome</u-r>-just one color&hellip;white skin, white hair, white eyes, white everything-the natural color of the marble they&rsquo;re carved from.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Profosser</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Now, the ideal of plain, white sculpture goes back to fifteenth-century Europe, when Renaissance artists rediscovered ancient Greek and Roman culture. They were inspired by sculptures that appeared monochrome, so they created <u-r>white marble statues</u-r>.The impact of these Renaissance statues, such as Michelangelo&rsquo;s David, gave rise to new standards for sculpture, standards that emphasized form rather than color.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Profosser</td>
<td style="text-align:left">But what if many of those ancient statues were originally polychrome-colored from head to toe? Early in the nineteenth century, archaeologists found traces of paint on ancient sculptures. And since then, classical art historians have begun to realize that Greek and Roman marble sculptures were originally colored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Profosser</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Even if an ancient marble statue doesn&rsquo;t have any visible traces of paint, that does not mean it was originally monochrome. In many cases, the pigment would have simply <u-r>deteriorated</u-r>—ancient artists used mineral-based paints with organic binding media that would&rsquo;ve disintegrated on its own over time. In other cases, the pigment may have been weathered away while exposed to the elements&hellip; or someone may have rigorously cleaned the statues and unknowingly removed the last traces of pigment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Profosser</td>
<td style="text-align:left">So&hellip;the fact is we do have evidence of polychrome sculptures from Greece and Rome from the seventh century B.C.E. all the way through at least the third or fourth century C.E.It&rsquo;s now generally accepted that most—maybe even all—marble sculptures from that time period received some kind of surface treatment like the application of pigments, colored stones, or metals that would&rsquo;ve modified their color.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Profosser</td>
<td style="text-align:left">So do we interpret a statue differently if we know it had originally been polychrome?I feel strongly when it comes to this.A marble sculpture that had been colored has another layer of meaning that was meant to affect the viewer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Profosser</td>
<td style="text-align:left">As art historians, we must try to interpret the intentions of the artists—what were the artists trying to achieve?Certain features of the sculpture were highlighted through color, were made to stand out&hellip;.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Profosser</td>
<td style="text-align:left">In other words, they caused the viewer to focus on certain features.And certain colors represented certain things to the ancient artists and cultures: a color might symbolize heroism, divinity, or youth.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Profosser</td>
<td style="text-align:left">One example to consider is the statue of Roman Emperor Augustus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Profosser</td>
<td style="text-align:left">This particular statue of Augustus that I&rsquo;m referring to was discovered just outside of Rome in 1863, and was in terrific condition.It&rsquo;s about two meters tall-just larger than life-size.It was made from an expensive, high-quality type of marble, and was obviously carved by an expert.</td>

<p>Now&hellip; it still had visible traces of color on the hair, eyes, and its clothing and armor.The paints have been very carefully studied, and it turns out that the colors weren&rsquo;t just from any pigments—they were from expensive pigments.The use of these pigments showed the importance of Augustus and that he should be honored.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s consider the extensive traces of a red pigment that were found on the statue&rsquo;s cloak.The cloak&rsquo;s a special garment that was traditionally worn by an emperor on the battlefield, and in real life was a red color which, to the Romans, signified the emperor&rsquo;s authority—military and political authority.</p>
<p>OK&hellip;I won&rsquo;t point out any further details about the colors on the Augustus statue, because you can already begin to see that there was cultural importance associated with the colors—symbolism which should help us understand the statue better.</p>
<p>There are many, many more sculptures that have traces of pigments left on them, and we have the technology these days to be able to carry out effective studies of these pigments.There&rsquo;s a lot of work to be done. But it needs to be done fast.Like I said before, these pigments deteriorate rapidly.So we really need to do the research before the traces are gone, so that we can increase our understanding of ancient polychrome sculptures and the cultures which created them.</p>
