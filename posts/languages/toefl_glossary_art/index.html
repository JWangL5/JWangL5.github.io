<li>To demonstrate the size of most Paleolithic cave art</li>
<li><strong>To emphasize his point about the age of Chauvet paintings</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the professor’s opinion about the art at the Chauvet cave?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It is extremely well done</strong></li>
<li>It probably reflected artists’ religious beliefs</li>
<li>It is less sophisticated than the art at Lascaux and Altamira</li>
<li>It is probably not much older than the art at Lascaux and Altamira</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the professor, what is the significance of charcoal marks on the walls of the Chauvet cave?</p>
<ul>
<li>They suggest that Paleolithic people cooked their food in the cave</li>
<li><strong>They prove that people came to the cave long after the paintings were made</strong></li>
<li>They show how much light the Paleolithic artists needed for their work</li>
<li>They were used in recent times to date the paintings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compared to other Paleolithic art, what is unusual about the animals painted at Chauvet?</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of them are horses</li>
<li><strong>Many of them are dangerous</strong></li>
<li>Many of them are shown alongside humans</li>
<li>All of them are species that are still found in France</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are two questions about the Chauvet cave artists that the professor raises but cannot answer?</p>
<ul>
<li>How they lighted their work area</li>
<li>How they obtained pigments for their paints</li>
<li><strong>Why they chose to paint certain animals and not others</strong></li>
<li><strong>Why they placed their art in dark, uninhabited places</strong></li>
</ul>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Some of the world&rsquo;s oldest preserved art is the cave art of Europe, most of it in Spain and France. And the earliest cave paintings found to date are those of the <strong>Chauvet Cave</strong> in France discovered in 1994.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">And you know, I remember when I heard about the results of the dating of the Chauvet paintings, I said to my wife, &ldquo;Can you believe these paintings are over 30,000 years old?&ldquo;and my 3-year-old daughter <u-g>piped up</u-g> and said, &ldquo;Is that older than my great-grandmother?&rdquo; [amused sounds from audience] But, uh, That was the oldest age she knew. And you know, come to think of it, It&rsquo;s pretty hard for me to really understandhow long 30,000 years is too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">I mean, we tend to think that people who lived at that time must have been pretty <u-r>primitive</u-r>&hellip;, but I&rsquo;m gonna show you some slides in a few minutes, and I think you&rsquo;ll agree with me that this art is anything but primitive-They are masterpieces.And they look so real, so alive that it&rsquo;s very hard to imagine that they are so very old.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Now, not everyone agrees on exactly how old. A number of the Chauvet paintings have been dated by a lab to 30,000 or more years ago. That would make them not just older than any other cave art, but about twice as old as the art in the caves at <strong>Altamira or Lascaux</strong>, which you may have heard of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Some people find it hard to believe Chauvet is so much older than Altamira and Lascaux, and they noted that only one lab did the dating for Chauvet, without independent confirmation from any other lab.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">But be that as it may, whatever the exact date, whether it&rsquo;s 15,000, 20,000 or 30,000 years ago, the Chauvet paintings are from the <u-r>dawn</u-r> of art, so they are a good place to start our discussion of cave painting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Now, one thing you&rsquo;ve got to remember is the context of these paintings. Paleolithic humans - that&rsquo;s the period we are talking about here, the Paleolithic, the early stone age, not too long after humans first arrived in Europe. The climate was significantly colder then, and so rock shelters-shallow caves-were valued as homes protected from the wind and rain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">And in some cases at least, artists drew on the walls of their homes.But many of the truly great cave art sites-like Chauvet-were never <u-r>inhabited</u-r>. These paintings were made deep inside a dark cave, where no natural light can <u-g>penetrate</u-g>. There&rsquo;s no evidence of people ever living here-Cave bears, yes, but not humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">You would have had to make a special trip into the cave to make the paintings, and a special trip to go see it, and each time you&rsquo;d have to bring along torches to light your way. And people did go see the art-there&rsquo;s <u-r>charcoal marks from their torches</u-r> on the cave walls, clearly dating from thousands of years after the paintings were made, so we can tell people went there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">They came but they didn&rsquo;t stay. Deep inside a cave like that is not really a place you&rsquo;d want to stay, so, why? What inspired the Paleolithic artists to make such beautiful art in such inaccessible places? We&rsquo;ll never really know, of course, though it&rsquo;s interesting to <u-g>speculate</u-g>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">But, um, getting to the paintings themselves. Virtually all Paleolithic cave art represents animals, and Chauvet is no exception. The artists were highly skilled at using-or even enhancing-the natural shape of the cave walls to give depth and perspectives to their drawings. The sense of motion and vitality in these animals-Well, wait till I show you the slides.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Anyway, most Paleolithic cave art depicts large herbivores. Horses are most common overall with deer and <u-r>bison</u-r> pretty common too. Probably animals they hunted. But earlier at Chauvet, there is a significant interest in large dangerous animals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Lots of <u-r>rhinoceros</u-r>, lions, mammoth, bears&hellip;remember that the ranges of many animal species were different back then, so all these animals actually lived in the region at that time-but the Chauvet artists didn&rsquo;t paint people. There is a half-man-half-bison creature and there is outlines of human hands, but no depiction of a full human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor</td>
<td style="text-align:left">So, why these <u-r>precise</u-r> animals? Why not birds, fish, snakes? Was it for their <u-r>religion</u-r>? Magic? Or sheer beauty? We don&rsquo;t know, but whatever it was, it was worth it to them to spend hours deep inside a cave with just a torch between them and utter darkness. So&hellip;, on that note, let&rsquo;s dim the lights, so we can see these slides and actually look at the techniques they used.</td>

<li>古希腊最有名的艺术成就是各种雕塑，体现人体的完美性 (idealization of the human body), 比如，大家熟悉的《米洛斯的维纳斯》。</li>
<li>古希腊雕塑分为三个时期：古风时期(Archaic)、 古典时期(Classical)、希腊化时期(Hellenistic), 风格越来越成熟，而最杰出的希腊化时期的代表作就是《米洛斯的维纳斯》和《拉奥孔》。</li>
<li>古罗马人非常欣赏古希腊的雕塑，甚至会刻意做仿制品。但是，古罗马虽然创造力稍微弱一点，但是也有自己的独特之处。古罗马的雕塑主要是为了战争和政治服务，传达权力信息，比如：罗马帝国皇帝屋大维，又称Augustus的雕塑。</li>
<li>在建筑方面，古希腊和古罗马也取得了辉煌的成就：古希腊的代表建筑是帕特农神庙 (Parthenon Temple), 而古罗马的代表建筑是万神殿 (Pantheon)。</li>
<li>万神殿由前面的方形神殿和后面的圆形穹顶组成，这座圆形穹顶直径43.4米，很长一段时间都是世界之最，穹顶中央有一个9米宽的圆洞。整个神殿没有窗户，全靠圆洞透光照亮厅堂。万神殿中还葬着文艺复兴时期的大师——拉斐尔。</li>

<p>Why does the professor mention statues created by Renaissance artists in fifteenth-century Europe?</p>
<ul>
<li>To emphasize the importance of color in Renaissance works of art</li>
<li>To help explain the method used to determine the age of a statue</li>
<li><strong>To point out the origin of the belief that ancient marble statues were monochrome</strong></li>
<li>To point out that Renaissance artists used other materials besides marble to create statues</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the main purpose of the lecture?</p>
<ul>
<li>To explain why a particular statue of a Roman emperor is so famous</li>
<li><strong>To discuss how classical Greek and Roman statues looked in ancient times</strong></li>
<li>To describe the types of pigments Greek and Roman artists applied to statues</li>
<li>To explain a shift from monochrome to polychrome statues in ancient times</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the professor, what are two reasons that ancient statues may no longer have any visible traces of paint?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The paint was eroded away.</strong></li>
<li>The marble absorbed the paint over time.</li>
<li>Museum curators intentionally removed the paint.</li>
<li><strong>The paint was accidentally removed during cleaning.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the professor&rsquo;s opinion about ancient statues that were once painted?</p>
<ul>
<li>They should be judged by their form rather than their color.</li>
<li><strong>They should be interpreted with the artists&rsquo; intentions in mind.</strong></li>
<li>They should be fully restored to their original colors.</li>
<li>They probably represent only a small minority of classical statues.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the professor, what is significant about the paint on the statue of Augustus?
- It helped protect the statue from erosion.
- <strong>The different colors were made from valuable pigments.</strong>
- The color of the armor indicated the youth of Augustus.
- <strong>The color of the cloak symbolized authority.</strong></p>
<p>What does the professor imply that art historians should do?
- Try to preserve deteriorating ancient pigments with an organic surface treatment.
- Educate the public about the damage caused by cleaning works of art.
- <strong>Study the remaining traces of pigments on as many ancient sculptures as possible.</strong>
- Try to re-create the mineral-based paints that were used in ancient times.</p>

<td style="text-align:left">I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve all been to a museum where you&rsquo;ve seen beautiful <u-r>white marble statues</u-r> sculpted by the Greeks and Romans&hellip; or at least that you&rsquo;ve seen photos of such statues, right? We have come to expect these classical Greek and Roman statues to be <u-r>monochrome</u-r>-just one color&hellip;white skin, white hair, white eyes, white everything-the natural color of the marble they&rsquo;re carved from.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Profosser</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Now, the ideal of plain, white sculpture goes back to fifteenth-century Europe, when Renaissance artists rediscovered ancient Greek and Roman culture. They were inspired by sculptures that appeared monochrome, so they created white marble statues. The impact of these Renaissance statues, such as Michelangelo&rsquo;s David, gave rise to new standards for sculpture, standards that emphasized form rather than color.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Profosser</td>
<td style="text-align:left">But what if many of those ancient statues were originally polychrome-colored from head to toe? Early in the nineteenth century, <u-r>archaeologists</u-r> found traces of paint on ancient sculptures. <u-b>And since then, classical art historians have begun to realize that Greek and Roman marble sculptures were originally colored.</u-b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Profosser</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Even if an ancient marble statue doesn&rsquo;t have any visible traces of paint, that does not mean it was originally monochrome. In many cases, the pigment would have simply <u-r>deteriorated</u-r>—ancient artists used <u-r>mineral-based paints with organic binding media</u-r> that would&rsquo;ve <u-r>disintegrated</u-r> on its own over time. In other cases, the pigment may have been weathered away while exposed to the elements&hellip; or someone may have <u-r>rigorously</u-r> cleaned the statues and unknowingly removed the last traces of pigment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Profosser</td>
<td style="text-align:left">So&hellip;the fact is we do have evidence of <u-r>polychrome</u-r> sculptures from Greece and Rome from the seventh century B.C.E. all the way through at least the third or fourth century C.E. It&rsquo;s now generally accepted that most—maybe even all—marble sculptures from that time period received some kind of surface treatment like the application of pigments, colored stones, or metals that would&rsquo;ve modified their color.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Profosser</td>
<td style="text-align:left">So do we interpret a statue differently if we know it had originally been polychrome? I feel strongly when it comes to this. A marble sculpture that had been colored has another layer of meaning that was meant to affect the viewer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Profosser</td>
<td style="text-align:left">As art historians, we must try to interpret the intentions of the artists—what were the artists trying to achieve? Certain features of the sculpture were highlighted through color, were made to stand out&hellip;.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Profosser</td>
<td style="text-align:left">In other words, they caused the viewer to focus on certain features. And certain colors represented certain things to the ancient artists and cultures: a color might symbolize <u-r>heroism, divinity, or youth</u-r>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Profosser</td>
<td style="text-align:left">One example to consider is the statue of Roman Emperor Augustus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Profosser</td>
<td style="text-align:left">This particular statue of Augustus that I&rsquo;m referring to was discovered just outside of Rome in 1863, and was in terrific condition. It&rsquo;s about two meters tall-just larger than life-size. It was made from an expensive, high-quality type of marble, and was obviously carved by an expert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Profosser</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Now&hellip; it still had visible traces of color on the hair, eyes, and its clothing and <u-r>armor</u-r>.The paints have been very carefully studied, and it turns out that the colors weren&rsquo;t just from any pigments—they were from expensive pigments. The use of these pigments showed the importance of Augustus and that he should be honored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Profosser</td>
<td style="text-align:left">And let&rsquo;s consider the extensive traces of a red pigment that were found on the statue&rsquo;s <u-r>cloak</u-r>. The cloak&rsquo;s a special <u-r>garment</u-r> that was traditionally worn by an emperor on the battlefield, and in real life was a red color which, to the Romans, signified the emperor&rsquo;s authority—military and political authority.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Profosser</td>
<td style="text-align:left">OK&hellip;I won&rsquo;t point out any further details about the colors on the Augustus statue, because you can already begin to see that there was cultural importance associated with the colors—symbolism which should help us understand the statue better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Profosser</td>
<td style="text-align:left">There are many, many more sculptures that have traces of pigments left on them, and we have the technology these days to be able to carry out effective studies of these pigments. There&rsquo;s a lot of work to be done. But it needs to be done fast. Like I said before, these pigments <u-r>deteriorate</u-r> rapidly. So we really need to do the research before the traces are gone, so that we can increase our understanding of ancient polychrome sculptures and the cultures which created them.</td>

<td style="text-align:left">Opera was <u-r>commonplace</u-r> in Italy for almost thousands of years before it became commercial as a <u-r>venture</u-r>. And during those years several things happened primarily linguistic or <u-r>thematic</u-r> and both involving <u-r>secularization</u-r>.</td>

<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Musical drama started in the churches. It was an educational tool. It was used primarily as a vehicle for teaching <u-r>religion</u-r> and was generally presented in Latin, the language of the Christian Church, which had considerable influence in Italy at that time.</td>

<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">But the language of everyday life was evolving in Europe, and at a certain point in the Middle Ages, it was really only <u-r>merchants</u-r>, <u-r>aristocrats 贵族</u-r>, and <u-r>clergy 神职人员</u-r> who can deal with Latin.</td>

<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">The vast majority of the population used their own regional <u-r>vernacular 方言</u-r> in all aspects of their lives, and so, in what is now Italy, operas quit being presented in Latin and started being presented in Italian.</td>

<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">And once that happened, the themes of the opera presentations also started to change, and musical drama moved from the church to the <u-r>plaza 广场</u-r> right outside the church. And the themes again, the themes changed, and opera was no longer about teaching religion as it was about <u-r>satire 讽刺</u-r>, and about expressing the ideas of society or government without committing yourself to writing and risking <u-r>imprisonment 监禁</u-r> or <u-r>persecution 迫害</u-r> or what have you.</td>

<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Opera, as we think of it, is of course a <u-r>resurrected</u-r> form. It is the <u-r>melodious</u-r> drama of ancient Greek theater, the term &ldquo;melodious drama&rdquo; being shortened eventually to &ldquo;melodrama&rdquo; because operas frequently are <u-r>melodramatic</u-r>, not to say unrealistic.</td>

<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">And the group that put the first operas together that we have today then, were, well&hellip; it was a group of men that included <p-g>Galileo&rsquo;s father Vincenzo</p-g>, and they met in Florence. He and a group of friends of <p-g>the Count of Bardi</p-g> and they formed what is called the <p-g>Giovanni de&rsquo; Bardi</p-g>.

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Now, what happened in the following centuries is very simple. Opera originated in Italy but was not confined to Italy any more than Italians were.

<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">What happened is that the major divide in opera that endures today took place.

<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">And so the music was secondary, if you will, to the dramatic cadence of language, to the way the rhythm of language was used to express feeling and used to add drama, and of course as a result, instead of <u-r>arias 歌剧</u-r>, or solos which would come to dominate Italian opera, the French relied on what the Italians called &ldquo;recitativo&rdquo; or &ldquo;recitative&rdquo; in English, the lyrics were spoken&hellip; frequently to the accompaniment of a <u-r>harpsichord 大键琴</u-r>.</td>

<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">The French said, &ldquo;You really can&rsquo;t talk about real people who lived, in opera.&rdquo; And they relied on <u-r>mythology 神话</u-r> to give them their characters and their plots.

<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">The English appropriated opera after the French. Opera came late to England because all theaters, public theaters were closed, of course, during their civil war. And it wasn&rsquo;t until the restoration in 1660 that public theaters again opened and opera took off.</td>

<td style="text-align:left">Professor:</td>
<td style="text-align:left">The English made a major adjustment to opera and exported what they had done to opera back to Italy. So that you have this circle of musical influences. The Italians invented opera. The French adapted it. The English adopted it. The Italians took it back.</td>

<td style="text-align:left">It came to America late and was considered too <u-r>elitist</u-r> for the general public, but Broadway musicals fulfilled a similar function for a great long while. John J. Chapman wrote about opera, quote, &ldquo;If an extraterrestrial being were to appear before us and say, &lsquo;What is your society like? What is this Earth thing all about?&rsquo; you could do worse than take that creature to an opera,&rdquo; end quote. Because opera does, after all, begin with a man and a woman and an emotion.</td>

    <a href="#%e6%96%87%e8%89%ba%e5%a4%8d%e5%85%b4-renaissance" class="header-mark"></a>文艺复兴 (Renaissance)</h3><ul>
<li>
<p>文艺复兴是14-16世纪欧洲的一场启蒙运动。当时的人想要“复兴”古希腊(ancient Greek)和古罗马(ancient Roman)的艺术形式</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>第一个提出文艺复兴概念的是意大利艺术史学家瓦萨里(Giorgio Vasari) , 他在《艺苑名人传》(Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and Architects)中第一次提到了“文艺复兴三杰”，他们确立了绘画的古典体系——透视(perspective) 正确，写实创作，人物生动。
-达 ·芬奇 (Da Vinci)：文艺复兴时期最著名的艺术家，他的代表作有肖像画《蒙娜丽莎》(Mona Lisa)，藏于卢浮宫(Louvre)，壁画《最后的晚餐》(The Last Supper)
-米开朗基罗 (Michelangelo)：瓦萨里书中用了最长的篇幅来描述他，并将其作为评估其他艺术家的标尺(benchmark)，他的代表作是梵蒂冈(Vatican)西斯廷教堂天顶(Sistine Chapel ceiling)的壁画和位于佛罗伦萨(Florence)学院美术馆的雕塑《大卫》(David)</p>
<ul>
<li>拉斐尔(Raphael)：文艺复兴三杰中最年轻的一位，被誉为画圣，他为罗马教皇创作了大型的壁画(frescos)，其中最出名的是《雅典学院》(The School of Athens)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>艺术技法</p>
<ul>
<li>对立式平衡法(contrapposto)：通过展示身体形态上的的轻微扭曲(slight twist) 来增加艺术人物的真实性。雕塑《大卫》就使用了这样的技法。但是这种方法一旦使用不好，模拟出的人体形态容易让整个人看起来不太自然(unnatural) , 所以Alberti建议艺术家应该模拟人类的骨头结构，从而能够准确地确定人物的身体比例</li>
<li>线性单点透视(liner one-point perspective)：画一些平行的直线，这些直线会从画作的最前端一直延续到背景形成一个视觉上的消失点(vanishing point)。通过使用这样的方法，艺术家可以在平面上创造出立体的效果，作品会更真实</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>文艺复兴时期的花园是面积很大，非常奢华的(lavish)庭院，是一种体现花园主人地位的象征。这些花园里面有很多的机关(tricks)和迷宫(maze)用来吸引人们，花园越有名气，花园的主人越有地位。</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>TPO37-L3,TPO41-L3,TPO45-L1,TPO33-L2</p>
<ul>
<li>公元5世纪到15世纪，欧洲经历了被基督教统治的中世纪 (Medieval)，而16世纪之后，随着文艺复兴 (Renaissance) 的到来，尽管该时期依然是具有宗教色彩的时期，但欧洲文明开始从宗教化向世俗化(secularization) 转变。这种转变在歌剧和绘画中均有体现
<ul>
<li>最初，歌剧用拉丁语(Latin)写成，被当成教授宗教教义(teach religion)的工具。但是，拉丁语只被少数权贵阶层所掌握：贵族(aristocrat)、神职人员(clergy)和商人(merchant)。而在文艺复兴时期，意大利人开始用意大利语 (Italian)写剧，使得平民百姓也可以解到歌剧。随着语言的变化，歌剧的主题也从教授宗教教义转变成反映世俗话题，甚至出现了讽刺剧(satire), 表达人们对社会和政府的看法。意大利人强调歌剧的纪实性 (historical)以及旋律性。但是传入法国后，法国人更强调歌剧朗诵时的抑扬顿挫 (cadence), 并认为歌剧不应该使用真实的人物形象作为主人公。</li>
<li>文艺复兴时期，艺术家不再将绘画的主题(subject matter)局限于宗教故事和宗教人物，而开始描绘真实世界(natural world), 通过画人物肖像(portrait)和自然风景(landscape)，反映真实世界。
<blockquote>
<p>The Renaissance was still a pretty religious period, and that&rsquo;s reflected in the artwork of that time. But artists were starting to experiment with a more secular point of view as well, a tendency to also use the natural world as the subject matter for their art.</p>
